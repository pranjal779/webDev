                        <p>
                            Writing code for complex games can be challenging and time-consuming. <br>
                            It can also be frustrating if, after all the work, the game doesn't catch on. <br>
                            To be successful in this field, game developers need to be resilient as well as creative. <br>
                            If one solution doesn't work, they must be able to come up with another viable one.

                            If you are creating games for Android, knowing Java is essential. <br>
                            To write game engines, you must be proficient in C++. <br>
                            It will also help if you know C, C#, Python, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and SQL.
