      "<b>History</b> is always written by the <strong>winners</strong>.<br>
      When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, <br>
      and the winner writes the history booksâ€”<u>books</u> which <br>
      glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe.<br> 
      As Napoleon once said, <br>
      <em>'What is history, but a fable agreed upon?'</em>"<br>
